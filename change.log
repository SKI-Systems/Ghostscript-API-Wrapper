*** Version 1.00.1 ***
- added Free Pascal/Lazarus support
- added Run* operrations to TGS_Api
- added OnAfterInitWithArgs event to execute Run* operations
- added TGS_Api.CheckResult for each gsapi_ call, to check if gsapi_exit have to be called. When yes this function will call gsapi_exit and stores this information in GSExit.

- added display_memfree to the compiler switch USE_GSDisplayMemAlloc to avoid memory leaks of Ghostscript
